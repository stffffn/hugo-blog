> New blog, who dis?

Like a month ago, I changed my mind and wanted to give [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a go. My first impression of static site generators along the lines of Hugo wasn't the best, when I played around with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ages ago. That's why I initially went with the route of building my own with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/). But since I'm always curious about different approaches, I'm now running Hugo and so far I quite like it. It definitely has a learning curve to it, which wasn't too steep for such a basic blog.

I basically ported my old blog to Hugo with some minor adjustments in styling and the decision of not using any JavaScript or other external, not-self-hosted dependencies. Therefore the old switch to toggle between light and dark mode is gone.

This is only the third post and I already switched the software but didn't deliver much content in the meantime...
