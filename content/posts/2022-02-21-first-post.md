This is an outdated post of my first blog. An update can be found here: [Same same but different](/post/2022/10/07/same-same-but-different/)

~~New blog and therefore the obligatory "first post" post.~~

~~There's no real theme to this blog and I won't post regularly or frequently. Well, I think this blog might even get abandoned sooner than later.~~

~~But for now I had the urge that I wanted a self-maintained, central place to collect some things and a blog appeared to be the most fitting solution for me. I could have gone the easy route and just use Jekyll in combination with Github, but I always feel like I don't have all of the control using one of these options.~~

~~That's why I cobbled together this thingy here and also finally took a look at Nextjs and Tailwind. This blog uses markdown files for its posts, all pages are statically generated and everything is built and published to Github pages through Github actions.~~

~~You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/stffffn/nextjs-blog).~~
